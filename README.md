# Problem

Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows 
presenting anything as significant (adapted from [Simmons et al., 2011]):

![](simmons_et_al_2011_table_1_5_perc.png)

Six requirements for authors to prevent this [Simmons et al., 2011]:

 * Authors must decide the rule for terminating data collection before data collection begins and report this rule in the article
 * Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else provide a compelling cost-of-data-collection justification
 * Authors must list all variables collected in a study
 * Authors must report all experimental conditions, including failed manipulations
 * If observations are eliminated, authors must also report what the statistical results are if those observations are included
 * If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the statistical results of the analysis without the covariate

Hypothesis: The prevalence of statistical reporting inconsistencies differs between COVID-19 and matched 
non-COVID-19 preprints [Wicherts, 2021, covid]
